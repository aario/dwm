dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

What's in this fork?
--------------------
My fork (aario) contains these features:
- based on version 6.1(20151109)
- Works only with dmenu blur branch
- Systray patch applied
- Status colors patch applied
- Per-window keyboard layout patch applied
- All shortcuts are now based on Win key (instead of Alt or Shift+Alt)
- Mod+L keys launch slock
- Mod+W keys launch dmenu_win (You have to install it from github.com/aario/dmenu along with wmctrl)
- Mod+N keys launch dmenu_media (Media player controller menu)
- Mod+C keys launch dmenu_custom which displays of a list of custom scripts located in $HOME/.dwm/custom_scripts
- Mod+H keys launch dmenu_home which browses through home folder and opens files
- Autostart all commands in ~/.dwm/autostart_blocking.sh and ~/.dwm/autostart.sh
- You can also close windows by Alt+F4

Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
